const message = `
create-neptune-app (placeholder)

This CLI will eventually scaffold a new Neptune project by:

- Creating a fresh project directory.
- Installing and wiring up the "neptune" core framework.
- Installing and wiring up the "neptoon" node-based UI editor.
- Generating a starter .neptune graph file and basic project structure.
- Adding dev scripts for building and running Neptune projects.

For now, this CLI is a non-functional placeholder that simply describes the intent.
