/**
 * Planned concept (not implemented):
 *
 * - Display kernels (native torch ops + custom kernels from Neptune).
 * - Let users connect nodes <-> networks visually:
 *   - Node → node
 *   - Node → network
 *   - Network → network
 * - Act as the editor for the `.neptune` graph file, keeping it in sync with the UI.
